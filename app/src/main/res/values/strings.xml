    <string name="app_name">The Cave</string>

    <string name="StoryIntro1">You wake up inside what appears to be some kind of cave.
    You sit and wonder for a while. You have no idea how you got here. All you can remember
    is your name. What was that again?</string>

    <string name="StoryIntro2">Aaah yes, that was it: %1$s! Right then %1$s, you\'re in a bit of
    a sticky situation here. What are you going to do first?</string>

    <string name="StartOption1">Stand up and look around</string>
    <string name="StartOption2">Pat around to see what you can find</string>
    <string name="StartOption3">Lay down and cry</string>

    <string name="Track1Intro">See, that would have been a smart idea if it wasn\'t so
        dark in here! You can\'t see anything, what\'s your next move?</string>

    <string name="Track1StartOption1">Fumble around and find a wall</string>
    <string name="Track1StartOption2">Pat around to see what you can find</string>
    <string name="Track1StartOption3">Squint your eyes and look harder</string>

    <string name="Track2Intro">It appears that your suspicions were correct, %1$s, you ARE in a cave! Other than a solitary
        rock, you find little of interest.</string>

    <string name="Track2StartOption1">Pick up the rock</string>
    <string name="Track2StartOption2">Try something else</string>

    <string name="Track2Option1Intro">You pull the rock but it doesn\'t come away from the ground.
    Instead, it moves about an inch or so towards you before stopping abruptly. You hear a faint click.
    Much to your amazement, a wall some way ahead of you appears to slide away, revealing a dim light in the distance.
    I hope you\'re alone in here, because the screeching of the wall as it slid away would have awoken anyone&#8230;</string>

    <string name="Track2_1_1">Find somewhere to hide</string>
    <string name="Track2_1_2">\"Hello?\"</string>
    <string name="Track2_1_3">Follow the light</string>
