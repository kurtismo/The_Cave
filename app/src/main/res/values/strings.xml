    <string name="StoryIntro1">You wake up inside what appears to be some kind of cave.
    You sit and wonder for a while. You have no idea how you got here. All you can remember
    is your name. What was that again?</string>

    <string name="StoryIntro2">Aaah yes, that was it: %1$s! Right then %1$s, you\'re in a bit of
    a sticky situation here. What are you going to do first?</string>

    <string name="StartOption1">Stand up and look around</string>
    <string name="StartOption2">Pat around to see what you can find</string>
    <string name="StartOption3">Lay down and cry</string>

    <string name="Track1Intro">See, that would have been a smart idea if it wasn\'t so fucking
    dark in here! You can\'t see anything, what\'s your next move?</string>

    <string name="Track1StartOption1">Fumble around and find a wall</string>
    <string name="Track1StartOption2">Pat around to see what you can find</string>
    <string name="Track1StartOption3">Squint your eyes and look harder</string>
